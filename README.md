# PLeTES (Platform for Software Testing Learning)

This is the PLeTES project documentation. 

## About PLeTES

PLeTES is the result of a research that has the goal of support students that are learning how to test software. The application provides a Platform that enable users to submit, build, test and retrieve data from their tests using a `NodeJS` and `Docker` backend, while integrating with a popular LLM (Large Language Model)(ChatGPT from OpenAI). 


PLeTES also includes a frontend client developed with `ReactJS` that can be used to interact with the backend API without friction.

## Paper abstract

Abstract. Software testing is an essential activity for ensuring software quality.
However, teaching it can be a challenge as it requires an understanding of complex
concepts and the application of practical techniques. This study aims to assess
the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and
the GPT-4 model as a facilitating tool for software test teaching and learning,
leveraging it by integrating it on a engaging and playful platform. Validation of
the platform involved a study with computer science students and professionals
in the software testing field. Qualitative analysis was conducted with professionals
and postgraduate students in computer science courses in northeastern
Brazil to assess the platform’s functionality and alignment with users’ expectations.
